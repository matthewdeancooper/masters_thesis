\chapter{Statement of contribution}
\label{ch:contribution}

This project was suggested by Simon Biggs and was presented with the freedom to explore any solution that the author believed would have clinical application. All research was conducted by the author; although, Simon suggested Nikolov et al. as an initial blueprint, with a focus on implementing their novel surface dice similarity coefficient. All code used in this project (except for common machine learning and computational packages) was written by the author and has been released under an open-source license. Additionally, the author built a custom PC with the GPU used for computation in this project - NVIDIA RTX 2070 Super. Simon Biggs organised access to clinical data on-site at Riverina Cancer Care Centre (RCCC), and provided a software solution for anonymising patient scans. Furthermore, Simon Biggs organised canine imaging data from the Small Animal Specialist Hospital (SASH) after suggesting that this would be a good place to start getting familiar with coding libraries. In addition to the above, Simon Biggs and Yu Sun provided weekly to bi-weekly feedback on the project direction over the course of the semester.
